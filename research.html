            Are you interested in research? Do you have the skill to think & make things happen, but waiting for right exposure to learn about it? Do you find the field of research out of your reach? Don't worry!! If research truly interests you, then this Expo is the perfect platform to set you back on fire! Currently, the construction industry in India is witnessing significant growth with an upstream growth proposed for next few decades. To meet the growing demand for complexity in construction activities, more government and industrial funds are now being pumped in, to push the limits of Indian research domain forward. The need for new materials, construction techniques, environmental and sustainability concerns, comes greater responsibilities to refine and reinvent the conventional realms of civil engineering. If you have the passion for such research, but unsure how to move on, we are here to help you

                Huge demand in the technical institutions for quality faculties is often acknowledged in public forums. “33 percent of the Sanctioned faculty strength is lying vacant”- Deccan Herald (Oct 2, 2017). Consider the fact that a large number of faculty positions being vacant in IITs, NITs etc. Teaching and research are not very often looked at viable career options by the cream student who is wooed by the huge opening salaries in the other industry. Also, the industry requires specialized personnel to cope up with emerging problems with new technologies and expertise. The industry position is increasingly getting very specific to core value which is momentous. So, why wait up? Make the first step towards your research career.

            <h4>At the level of an undergraduate program, the students are not appropriately exposed to opportunities in R&D sector and its facets of research, research skills and positions which are unique and relevant to core subject areas. Research Expo is organised as a part of annual association activity by Civil Engineering Association, IIT-Madras. This March, IIT Madras will have a selected lot of students from various institutions across South India on a walk through the research at our institute. Students can visit Civil engineering research labs, get exposed to various research programmes at IITM, interact with faculty and research scholars, and know more about the opportunities in academia and industry.
